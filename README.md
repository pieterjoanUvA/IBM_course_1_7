# IBM Coursera, Courses 1 to 7 of 8, Data Science Professional Certificate specialisation
- This repository contains all gathered files, from the various online platforms that were applied during these courses.
- The final project has a separate repository here on GitHub.

- Git LFS is applied since some 100mb+ files are committed, those files were used for the data mangling.
- Certificates can be reviewed on my LinkedIn account.

- And yes, lastly, the Coursera Honour Code, please respect that.

With Regards,

Pieter Joan
